    "# Analyzing Social Media's Impact on Mental Health\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation and Problem Statement \n",
    "\n",
    "Social media has become a central part of daily life. Social media allows for connection and information sharing but there have been growing concerns regarding the impact social media has on user's mental health. Some studies show that certain types of social media usage have a positive correlation with increased anxiety, stress, and a decrease in self-esteem. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to explore how social media usage is associated with mental health. From a Human-Centered perspective, understanding this relationship can help inform mental health educators and promote healthier digital habits. This analysis can also provide insight for individuals to self-regulate their social media usage. I want to identify patterns and behaviors that may be associated with positive or negative mental health outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Selected for Analysis \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that I want to use is the \"Social Media and Mental Health\" dataset on Kaggle. This dataset has survey responses on various aspects of social media and mental health indicators. It also contains demographic information which can give insights across age groups and gender. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Link to the Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/souvikahmed071/social-media-and-mental-health)\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is available under the Creative Commons License. \n",
    "\n",
    "I think this dataset is suitable for my research goal because it contains both social media and mental health indicators which is the main part of my analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "One ethical consideration is that since the data in the dataset is all self-reported, participants may under-report or over-report  their social media usage and mental health status.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Unknowns and Dependencies \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of unknowns and dependencies. First is that because the data is all self-reported, there may be biased that affect the accuracy of my findings. Second, there may be missing data that could require extra cleaning. Third, is that the dataset is not really clear on what types of content is consumed on the apps which could effect the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to investigate the relationship between social media usage patterns and mental health. By analyzing survey data on social media usage and mental health indicators, the goal is to find patterns of how social media use may correlate with positive or negative mental health. Insights from this research could help individuals regulate their social media usage and make healthier digital habits. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Questions \n",
    "\n",
    "1. How does the amount of time spent on social media correlate with levels of anxiety and stress among users?\n",
    "2. Does the type of content consumed on social media impact mental health differently?\n",
    "3. Are there differences in mental health impacts of social media based on demographic factors? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background and Related Work \n",
    "\n",
    "social media's impact on mental health has been a hot topic with multiple studies showing both positive and negative correlations. Research studies have shown that prolonged use of social media can be associated with higher levels of depression and loneliness. It was also found that teenagers who spent more than three hours a day on social media felt isolated (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6214874/). \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, some studies have shown that social media has some positive effects. Some users reported feeling more connected and supported, being able to reach out to their friends and keep up with their lives through their posts (https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/71/1/56/6124731?login=false). To me, these mixed findings mean that social media can impact mental health depending on how it is used and the content the users are watching. \n",
    "\n",
    "The previous studies will influence my decisions on this study because they suggest specific factors and demographics to study. Specifically looking at time spent, usage type, platform type, feedback, age, gender, cultural background, and education level.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology \n",
    "\n",
    "My methodology to investigate this data and present my findings will have multiple steps. First, I will clean and prepare the data. For this dataset, it means renaming the columns because some of them have long names which could make the code messy, and dealing with missing values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data is cleaned and ready, I will calculate some descriptive statistics to get an overview of the dataset. Statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation could help set a baseline and help with analysis. I then plan to create a correlation matrix to highlight any correlations between variables. I also plan to use linear regression to construct a model to examine the coefficients and understand how each of the different factors correlates with mental health. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also plan to create some visualizations as well. I will use a heatmap to show the correlations between different variables, and a bar chart to visualize the differences in mental health outcomes across different usage patterns or demographic groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "I think these methods are good for this study because they allow us to see the overview of relationships through correlations and visualizations and get an in-depth look at how specific behaviors are linked to mental health outcomes through regression. "
